Optimization dispatcher that can launch arbitrary external process to be used
to perform the actual optimization. This can be useful if you need to write
the evaluator as part of a larger, already existing application. This dispatcher
can offer the task description on stdin, or send it to a tcp/unix server.

Additionally, it can launch persisting applications in combination with the
tcp/unix server functionality. This is particularly useful for applications
that have a relatively long startup time, such as matlab.
